					<h3>Why Odo?</h3>
					<p>
						Odo gives your users secure access to internal applications without the cost and <br>hassel of managing VPNs. Odo expands secure access past traditional perimeter-<br>based network security with the power to grant access to any application, to any user,<br> from any device, while maintaining security hygiene.
					</p>
					<p>
						With Odo you can…
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Differentiate between corporate and personal devices.</li>
						<li>Limit sensitive data access to only corporate devices.</li>
						<li>Limit remote access to specific applications without exposing the network.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Odo is a SaaS platform that allows corporate IT organizations to provide secure <br>connectivity to corporate applications and services for designated audiences. <br>Luminate allows doing the above without exposing internal networks/data centers to <br>risks associated with network access and provides unparalleled visibility and <br>governance into activities that are performed by the accessing parties.
